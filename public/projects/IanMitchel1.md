My personal website is always evolving. Whenever a new technology comes out that I want to try, I usually want to test it on a personal website before I use it anywhere else. Most recently, I wanted to try my hand at Node.js and decided it would be a nice lightweight platform to develop a simple portfolio website with.

### Website Features

When I first started thinking about what I wanted to showcase on the website, there was a lot of feature creep. Having a mini Seattle drawn on canvas (the weather would update dynamically based on what they actually were experiencing) was a neat idea, but hard to blend into the main website design. Other features I decided to veto was a list of books I was reading, music I liked, etc. I started with what you might call a portal, and slimmed down the idea to a portfolio. The website would mainly serve as a list of projects I was working on or had worked on in the past.

After deciding on the features, I needed to decide on the technology powering it. Having a database seemed like overkill. I also wanted to try something I hadn't done before, so I decided to use a file based structure.

I initially went with Node.js because it is a rising star in the web development community, and I didn't have any experience with it at the time. I felt that Ruby on Rails was a little too much overhead for the website I had planned.

Due to hosting issues, I later rewrote my website to use Sinatra. I absolutely love the framework for smaller websites! I still have my [original Node.js website repository up](https://github.com/ianmitchell/ianmitchel1-node), if you wish to see the code.

### Future Plans

I plan on making the website a little more responsive soon. I also want to look into disabling custom fonts for mobile devices. Beyond that, this website is pretty much feature complete.

### Thoughts on Node.js

Overall, I enjoyed working with Node.js. I'm not sure I'd use it on a larger website quite yet, but for something small it works great. I can't wait to see how it develops. I'll certainly be keeping an eye on it.
