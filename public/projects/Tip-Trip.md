I'm a member of Tip Trip, a Cal Poly based startup. While my job currently is just to design and maintain a static website, should we expand I will be tasked with creating a web interface, database, and API to complement apps on other platforms.

### Goal

Our original goal was to ensure students out partying could get an easy, safe ride home. They would open the app, find a driver they knew and trusted, and arrange for a ride home at the cost of some form of compensation specified by the driver (for instance, a slice of pizza).

### Status

While not officially launched yet, everyone is still hard at work. We hope to have released our product by June 2013!
