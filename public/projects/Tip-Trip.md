I'm a member of Tip Trip, a Cal Poly based startup. While my job currently is just to design and maintain a static website, should we expand I will be tasked with creating a web interface, database, and API to complement apps on other platforms.

### Goal

Our original plan was to ensure students who were out partying could get an easy, safe ride home. They would open the app, find a driver they knew and trusted, and arrange for a ride home at the cost of some form of compensation specified by the driver (for instance, a slice of pizza).

### Website Specification

My task was to create an "Apple" inspired website. [You can find the design here](http://ianmitchel1.com/tiptrip/index.html). Although actual content was never finished, the design was all but finalized.

### Status

This project is on hold indefinitely while members deal with senior projects and graduation. We hope to start working on Tip Trip again soon!
