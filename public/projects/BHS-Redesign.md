During my senior year at [Bainbridge High School (BHS)](http://www.bisd303.org/site/Domain/8), it was announced that the administration would be looking at upgrading all the district websites. Due to IT costs, they were considering outsourcing the design and development to a third party company. My Digital Design teacher, Ms. Rose, asked me to create a mockup to show to the committee in the hopes that they might ask students to create a design to use. I was given less than 24 hours to create a proposal mockup to present as an alternative to the companies in-house design.

### Design Decisions

I wanted to keep the same general structure of the old website, while introducing newer innovations and streamlining the design. It would need to be able to work with a variety of colors depending on the school (for example, while BHS might use White, Gold, and Blue, Woodward Middle School would be White, Green, and Brown).

#### Image Header

One of the main changes was a rotating image header. Before, a random image was chosen and displayed on each page load -- the feature was a favorite among the community, and themed pictures were put up for events such as Thanksgiving, Winter Break, etc. I expanded on this idea and used the [Nivo Slider](http://dev7studios.com/nivo-slider/) jQuery plugin to display all the images in a rotating banner. 

#### Footer

Another significant change was the footer -- instead of just having a copyright, I added in some of the most visited links for easier access. I also inserted some other sections that as a team we felt were underutilized and visited, such as the "Clubs" and "Outside of School" pages. By putting these links in the footer, I ensured they weren't intruding on the content while still being easier to access. 

#### Mockup

[You can view the proposal mockup here](http://ianmitchel1.com/bhs/index.html). It isn't as clean as I'd like, but given the time constraints not everything could be pixel perfect! Areas of improvement include header padding, colors, tab width, and main content / sidebar styling. The actual content portion of the website is rather plain by design since the teachers liked to add their own "flair", but it could still be improved.

### Ultimate Outcome

Despite overwhelmingly positive feedback from the community, the committee decided to outsource the design and development of the website. I graduated before the switch occurred.

### Old Design

Although a working copy no longer exists, this is a leftover thumbnail of the old design - apologies for the small size!
