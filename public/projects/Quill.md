Quill was my test project for Ruby on Rails, much like this website is a test for Node.js. Rails became popular with the "Create a blog in 20 minutes" tutorial; I wanted to take that idea and expand on it a bit.

Quill is an Ajax heavy blogging platform that comes complete with an admin dashboard. You can write new posts, edit old ones, create new standalone pages -- it even has a content upload interface that ties into Amazon S3. I created Quill with the intention of using it as my portfolio website, before I decided to use something a little more lightweight.


### Status

Quill is an open source project on [Github](https://github.com/IanMitchell/Quill), but it hasn't hasn't seen much activity recently. Someday I might come back to it, but at the moment Quill is on the backburner. It's entirely functional, but adding new features isn't a priority for me right now.

### What came out of Quill

I learned a lot about Javascript, Coffeescript, and Ajax while creating Quill. I also solidified my understanding of Ruby on Rails. I can say without hesitation that Ruby on Rails is my favorite framework for creating websites at the moment, but I wouldn't use it for all scenarios (This website was created with Node.js).
